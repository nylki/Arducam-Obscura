Arducam-Obscura
===============

An arduino, light sensor and motor controlled pinhole camera project. This is the arduino code.

Overview
---------

The project uses an arduino fio v3 witch uses a voltage of 3.3v. The fio is used because of its LiPo charging capabilities
and small form factor. Further hardware used is a decent light sensor (reliable, linear output): a TSL2561 from Adafruit,
a small servo motor that can operate with 3.3v and a standard pushbutton.

Also a box is need for loading the film and mounting the electronics. A pinhole is needed as well of course (approx. 0.3mm with a distance of
approx. 40mm from pinhole to sensitive film plane. (focal length)
